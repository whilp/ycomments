Y Comments!
===========

This hack puts comments from Hacker News on the page you wrote. It's kind of
like Disqus backed by HN. Of course, it's affiliated with neither Disqus or HN.

How does it work?
=================

ycomments.js takes a Hacker News post ID and, via the iHackerNews third-party
API, extracts the comment thread associated the post. It then renders the
comment thread directly on your page. Like I said, it's like Disqus, but with
HN comments.

Wanna play along?
=================

This hack is being developed at Buildmadison, a 24 hour hackathon in Madison,
Wisconsin. If you'd like to collaborate on this hack, ping me (@lt_kije) on
Twitter, IRC (#buildmadison on freenode) or in person (beard, headphones and an
OpenBSD hackathon shirt in the main room).
